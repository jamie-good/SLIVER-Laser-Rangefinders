# Arctic Laser Rangefinders 

## Highlights

- Set-up, processing, and recording sketches for 5 different laser rangefinders. 

## Overview

This project deals with the development of 5 laser rangefinders: AdaFruit VL53L4CD, Garmin LIDARLite_v4LED, JRT 70m Green Laser Distance Sensor, Parallax LaserPING Rangefinder, and the SparkFun SFEVL53L1X. The associated microcontrollers used are SparkFun Artmeis Redboards and Arduino UNOs. The purpose of this project was to test lasers of different wavelengths to see which performs best in Arctic summers -- i.e., 24 hours of bright light, a white surface, and very cold temperatures.
